Learn more about Search here: https://www.google.com/search/howsearchworks/Special thanks to J.M.E.H van Bronswijk, author of 'House Dust Biology'. We exchanged emails to make sure I got my facts straight for this video. Below is an excerpt from her email to me, responding to my claims that start with a dash:- Around half of airborne dust particles under 100um are skin scalesThis is true for climates, regions and seasons where people live mostly indoors.The 1 to 2 g of skin scales shed each 24 hours will end up in places where people are present (and rub their skin or have textile moving over the skin).You can also look at it from a different angle: What else has the same size and could contribute? That will usually be pollen from outdoor sources, also depending on season, region and climate, as well as the ventilation regime of the building.However, taken as the median value over a whole year, I consider your statement correct for regions with a temperate climate.- 53% of dust particles vacuumed from a mattress were found to be skin scalesIt depends a little on the type of mattress. For polyether mattresses the amount may even be larger.For mattresses made of natural material it could be less since the mattress-material will also give off small particles.- larger particles consist mostly of fibers, eg. cotton, paper, wool, syntheticsThat's true .. including bread crumbs ..... üôÇ- skin scales seem to form a larger fraction of dust where we spend more time, e.g. in or near bed...... and on the couch used to view television or be active in gaming.It has to do with the constant production of skin scales over the 24 hours.- skin scales form a smaller fraction of dust if there are significant other sources, e.g. carpeting, dirt from outside etc.Yes, everyting you walk on with your shoes or that recieves dirt from the outside with other means, will have a lessr percentage of human skin scales.However, do not forget the skin scales of pets that will also be an active allergen for many people, and a food source for house dust mites.Information on dust particle size ¬©ISO.

Obama called Biden ‚Äúa profoundly decent man guided by his faith‚Äù and praised his ability to tackle the multiple crises besetting America, while taking direct aim at the current occupant of the White House as their root cause. ‚ÄúDonald Trump is the wrong president for our country,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúHe has had more than enough time to prove that he can do the job, but he is clearly in over his head. He cannot meet this moment.‚ÄùThe first night of the convention introduced the American public to an unprecedented all-virtual format due to the coronavirus pandemic. But, even without balloon-drops and a roaring crowd, the multi-day program still promises to contain a high-wattage roster of Democratic powerhouses, including former presidents Barack Obama and Bill Clinton, along with Biden's freshly announced running mate, Senator Kamala Harris.

He's a Golden Retriever puppy, and he loves chewing on socks, sleeves, strings, chom choms, shoes, and just about everything else really.  He's a really clever boy as well, and has learned how to sit, give paw, and he's taking to his crate quite well!  If you haven't seen our announcement yet, we've moved back to Canada now.  It‚Äôs been a very busy three months for us, as we transitioned back into living in Canada.  We‚Äôve both been taking time off of YouTube to think about what kind of content we want to make in the future.  Do we still want to vlog?  Do we still want to talk about food and travel?  We‚Äôre not too sure, and especially with our move back to Canada, where we can be closer to family and friends, we haven‚Äôt had much time to be as creative as we usually are.  Our focus first and foremost is taking care of our wellbeing, which we‚Äôve been neglecting for a long time.  We have more support here and more options.  And so, while we explore those options, and figure out what our next steps in life are, allow me to introduce you to the newest member of the Stawski family: Fudgy, the very sweet golden retriever puppy.  He‚Äôs been a huge help for me (Simon here) during this time, and I hope some of his cuteness brightens your day the way he‚Äôs brightened mine.I‚Äôd like to just post some videos of Fudgy being cute and silly for a while.  I‚Äôll be sharing some pics of him too, because I‚Äôm a fawning father alright?  He‚Äôs just so adorable ‚ù§Ô∏è#goldenretriever #puppy #omgheissocuteamiright?"

Of course, I've also got some Build A Ladder segments I've been planning, so I'm going to give myself a smaller work load but try to be more consistent. We'll see if I can stick to my personal goals. Simon too is also going to focus on the creative ideas and processes that he enjoys, so we're looking to more flexible.It‚Äôll be a change, but we‚Äôve dealt with change before.

In the case of UFC heavyweight champion Stipe Miocic's rubber match with Daniel Cormier at UFC 252, however, the third meeting surpassed anything that happened in the first two bouts as Miocic managed to outwork Cormier over five rounds for a unanimous decision victory in a thrilling battle.The hype train of rising bantamweight Sugar Sean O'Malley took a detour on its trip toward crossover stardom after an apparent leg injury led to an opportunistic finish from Marlon Chito Vera on Saturday.The first round and a half of the UFC 252 heavyweight clash between Jairzinho Rozenstruik and Junior dos Santos belonged to dos Santos, but Rozenstruik proved once again that it only takes one of his shots to turn a fight, scoring a TKO in the second round to rebound from a devastating loss in his last outing.SUBSCRIBE TO OUR CHANNEL:https://www.youtube.com/user/CBSSportsHQ FOLLOW US ON:Facebook - https://www.facebook.com/CBSSports/Instagram - https://www.instagram.com/cbssports/Twitter - https://twitter.com/CBSSports#UFC252 #Miocic #Cormier #UFC #MMA #SugarSeanOMalley #ChitoVera #Rozenstruik #JuniorDosSantos"

Rick has tested many irons including the TaylorMade P770 irons, TaylorMade P7MB irons, TaylorMade P7MC irons, Mizuno JPX 921 irons, Ben Hogan golf irons and many more. Rick heads out to The Marriott Worsley Park Golf & Country Club to review the TaylorMade P7MC irons and finally reveal which clubs he will be playing!‚ñ∫Become a FREE SUBSCRIBER to RICK SHIELS now http://bit.ly/SubRickShielsGolf‚ñ∫ Official Apparel and footwear partner: Nike Golf http://www.nike.com/golf‚ñ∫Official Garmin Ambassador: https://explore.garmin.com/en-GB/golf/‚ñ∫ Hit #Subscribe & #HitTheBell so you don't miss out on any new videos! -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------‚ñ∫My Links:Facebook  ‚ñ∫ https://www.facebook.com/RickShielsPGA/Twitter       ‚ñ∫ http://bit.ly/RickShielsTwitterInstagram ‚ñ∫ http://bit.ly/RickShielsIGWeb           ‚ñ∫ http://www.rickshielsgolf.co.uk/---------------------------------------------------------------------------------Hi I‚Äôm Rick Shiels, welcome to my channel RickShielsPGAGolf. This YouTube channel is designed to help you play better golf, also to help you enjoy your golf more! I specialise in golf club reviews, golf club unboxing, golf club news, golf club head to heads, and all about golf clubs. I also want to make you play better golf by providing coaching video on all topics about golf, how to fix your slice, fix your hook, help you drive the golf ball longer, hit your irons more pure, hit your irons closer to the hole and help you draw and fade your golf shots. I will also help you lower your score by chipping better by stopping you duff and thin chips, pitch the ball closer and also create backspin. Also I will provide you help to putt better and hole more putts! On this channel I also make fun and entertaining golf content based on crazy and sometimes ‚Äúgimmicky‚Äù golf clubs. I like to cut through the marketing hype about products and I like to give you the honest truth about golf equipment. If you enjoy the channel make sure you hit subscribe and also tap the notification bell so that you are always notified when I release a new video."
